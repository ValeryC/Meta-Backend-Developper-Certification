# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Concepts

## Inheritance
Inheritance is a fundamental concept in OOP that allows a class to inherit properties and behaviors from another class. The class that is being inherited from is called the base class or superclass, while the class that inherits from it is called the derived class or subclass. Inheritance promotes code reuse and allows for the creation of a hierarchy of classes.

## Polymorphism
Polymorphism is the ability of an object to take on many forms. In OOP, polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. This enables the use of a single interface to represent different types of objects, providing flexibility and extensibility in the code.

## Encapsulation
Encapsulation is the practice of bundling data and methods that operate on that data within a single unit, called a class. It allows for the hiding of internal details and provides a way to control access to the data. Encapsulation helps in achieving data abstraction and protects the integrity of the data by preventing direct access from outside the class.

## Abstraction
Abstraction is the process of simplifying complex systems by breaking them down into smaller, more manageable units. In OOP, abstraction is achieved through the use of abstract classes and interfaces. Abstract classes define common characteristics and behaviors that subclasses can inherit, while interfaces define a contract that classes must adhere to. Abstraction allows for the creation of modular and reusable code.

By understanding and applying these OOP concepts, you can design and develop software that is more modular, extensible, and maintainable.
